The Interactive Navigation Menu is a web-based user interface component that provides smooth navigation between different sections of a webpage. The navigation bar remains fixed at the top and dynamically changes its appearance when the user scrolls or clicks on menu items.

This project demonstrates the use of HTML for structure, CSS for styling and transitions, and JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic content handling.
